                exploration, guided by the knowledge of RateBeer and BeerAdvocate! These two remarkable websites have earned our 
                unwavering trust, and, based on our analysis, we hold them in equally high regard, a sentiment reflected in the 
                compelling graphs presented below:

                <h4>CDF of standardised user scores from Rate Beer and Beer Advocate</h4>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p >
                This plot shows the CDF of each website. By simply looking at it, we can make the hypothesis that BeerAdvocate 
                users tend to give higher z_score than RateBeer users. We will test this hypothesis later on.
            </p>

                <iframe class = "double-plots-left" src="plots/intro_zscore_vs_nbr_ratings_BA_99.html"></iframe>
                <iframe class = "double-plots-right" src="plots/intro_zscore_vs_nbr_ratings_RB_99.html"></iframe>
                <h4>Scatterplots of number of ratings vs scores for both websites (left - Beer Advocate, right - Rate Beer)</h4>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                These two plots give us a way to visualize the zscore distribution of the 1% of the most reviewed beers from 
                both sites. It also gives us an idea of the number of times that the most-rated beers are reviewed.
            <br>   
            <br>
                After graphing the data and analyzing it a little in the previous graphs, certain hypotheses need to be tested 
                so that they can be used correctly in the future. Indeed we are trying different tests to see if the z_score 
                distribution of the beers from the two websites are directly comparable.
            <br>
            <br>
                The CDF plot gave us the intuition that the z_score distribution of the beers from the two websites is not 
                directly comparable. We tried to confirm this intuition by doing two different hypothesis tests that we thought 
                were well suited to test our hypothesis. We first computed a permutation test which randomly shuffled the data 
                from the two different datasets and evaluate if the difference of z_score distribution is significant. The test 
                gave us a p-value of 0.0 which confirms our initial intuition that there is a significant difference between the 
                two distributions. 
                To be sure, we also tried to do a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test which gave us a p-value of 1.16e-24 which also confirmed our intuition.

                <h4>Comparing review numbers between the sites (left) and unique beers between the sites (right)</h4>

            </div>
            <p>
                The first plot shows the difference in the number of reviews year by year of the two websites. We can see that 
                while the number of reviews of both sites is increasing before 2014-2015, BeerAdvocate tend to grow faster than 
                (or has more active users) than RateBeer. We can also observe that both sites decreased in the number of reviews 
                after 2015. 
                <br>
                The number of reviews in 2017 for both sites is particularly low, this could be due to the fact that the dataset 
                may have been collected during 2017 and that the number of reviews of 2017 is not complete.
                <br>
                <br>
                The second plot shows the proportion of beer present on both websites versus the proportion of beer present on only one 
                of the two websites. We can see that the majority of the beer is present on both websites, which allows us to work 
                directly with matched files without "losing" too much data.
