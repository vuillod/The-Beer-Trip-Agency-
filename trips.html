                offers a serenade of subtle flavours, while Albania's beers are a symphony of finesse. Exploring the softer 
                side of beer in destinations like Jersey and Lebanon immerses you in a world where each sip becomes a delicate 
                note in a harmonious composition.

                particular: either they have many breweries and are small (interesting for this trip), or they are very large and

            <br>
            <p>
                We notice that beers from the USA are rated slightly higher than those from elsewhere. It's easy to see why Americans 
                are a bit chauvinistic, given that both sites come from North America and that most users are from there too. So it made 
                sense not to include more than two US states in each ranking, to reduce this effect.

                about beer, and you'll be going to the top-raFted places to taste it. Normally, you won't be disappointed after 
                going to these countries.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, as we can see on the barplot above, the standard deviation in each location is quite huge. It shows that,
                in a location, there are well-rated beers, but also some that are badly rated. The precision of this is not good 
                but still gives a good idea of the regions where the overall ratings of the beers are high. The moral is the 
                following: Keep paying attention to what you are drinking, bad beers exist even in those places!

                meeting beer experts and that's actually cool, all the BTA team agreed with you (we are the same)! It's so pleasant having 
                a chat on a terrace over a good IPA with a random person who shares the same passion as you!

                Meet Mohammad, a former winemaker turned beer curator on the <i> Connoisseur Chronicles</i>. Confronted with a 
                shortage of grapes, Mohammad redirected his expertise towards the world of beers. As an ex-winegrower, his refined 
                palate now selects only the finest beers. From the rich traditions of Belgium to the craft paradises of Vermont 
                and California, Mohammad's journey explores pub culture in England, innovation in Sweden and brewing heritage in 
                Poland. <i>The Hop Connoisseur Chronicles</i> is a symphony of flavors aiding Mohammad in perfecting his beer vision to 
                achieve the excellence he once attained in handling grapes. Join him on this connoisseur's odyssey, where every 
                sip tells the story of his transition from grape to grain. Excellence in every experience!

                You're an expert, aren't you? So it makes sense that you only trust people who also devote a large part of their time 
                to writing complete, structured analyses. However, we can see that the ranking is not very equitable and that the top 
                four locations are ahead by a long way. No need to panic! That's not to say that the others don't have some good beer 
                to try out - you'll just have to look a little harder to find it!
